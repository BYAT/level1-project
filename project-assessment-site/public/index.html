<h1>Project Assessment Site</h1>
<h3>Green lights == a pass</h3>

There should be a table with 3 people here
<div id="people">
    <h1 style="color: red">You haven't passed yet - you need the people service on port 8081</h1>
    <div>
        To pass you must also expose the services on public ports. You must do this using docker-compose to bring up
        all the services and website together as a single unit. You can all take one service each. The only overlapping
        file is the docker-compose.yaml, which your team-leader can merge.
